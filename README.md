# My alternative Idea of the given problem
When I look at this problem for the first time it looks simple (Just display the given name appended with the random no) but took a minute to analyze it in different perspective like Email Sender info 

1. To search/ get the count of the email's from this sender name
2. And that too adding a condition of min & max email msg's

# Input :
# Enter the name
# gsundar93@gmail.com
# ---------------------------------
# Output :
# gsundar93@gmail.com 11

# ---------------------------------

I have written this code in Java language & added my code features are

1. Can able to print the pattern as many times we need until the user exits from it

2. The random No can be generated for a custom range (User can able to input their own range)

3. Used Random Java API to generate the no between the given min & max
